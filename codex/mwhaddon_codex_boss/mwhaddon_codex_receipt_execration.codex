"1st Edition
Execration was meant to be an enhanced version of Dreadwing from the very beginning. In the early stages of development, its texture was a recolored version of Exemplar, a hidden boss from Letheia Expanded by SVA that uses exactly the same AI as Dreadwing does.
Some of its skills were designed with reference to Yharon from Calamity mod of Terraria, and Void Deformity, an unavailable boss from Arcana itself.

"A combination of Evolapis and Cosmo Nemesis was planned before the idea of Execration being put forward. The summoning item ^orange;Price of Prosperity^reset; (unobtainable now) was its legacy. The plan was dropped due to my incapability on understanding how behavior works.
",

"2nd Edition
One year after Execration was introduced, I picked up Starbound modding again. So Execration got updated as well. With my new spriter Rusteel's help, Execration got a new intro and death animation, which I think was pretty good.
I also made it more melee-friendly, that's why it's reinforcement attack was greatly remade.
