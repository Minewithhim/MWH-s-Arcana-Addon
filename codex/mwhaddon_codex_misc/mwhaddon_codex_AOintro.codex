Astral Observatory is a comprehensive service station founded by Arcanian stargazers of the Great Library and open to all interstellar travellers located in a comfortable oasis near the Khnemnn Island on the Azure Desert of Sirius II.

"In Astral Observatory you can experience the local Arcanian customs and culture, have your ship repaired in our repair dock, or enjoy a drink from the famous Atlantis Bar.

The Archivist there is in charge of all the work in Astral Observatory, but they do take time to welcome every traveller who has the wish to pay a visit as well.
