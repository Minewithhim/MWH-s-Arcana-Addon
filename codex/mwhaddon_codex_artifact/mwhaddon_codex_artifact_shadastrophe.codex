"^yellow;So you are leaving, for a new world we know nothing about. 

^green;That's why I come to say goodbye. You're the last one. I'll leave when I'm done here.

^yellow;You made a deal with him?

^green;Yes. And I volunteered for it.",


"^yellow;You'd better think it over. I still don't think he's trustworthy.

^green;And even then I'll go, it's the only way I'll ever learn more about what I'm pursuing.

^yellow;...you're still the same, as stubborn as always.

^green;And you? Have you found the meaning of your existence in the world?",


"^yellow;Perhaps. At least I can take their death as calmly as I'm now.

^green;I guess so. You've changed a lot in my eyes. I've never seen you smile before.

^yellow;Full of craps... Here, take this.",


"^green;That's... Shadastrophe? For why?

^yellow;A memento, in case you feel lonely there.

^green;Then I still think it's better if you keep it. It's more connected to you.

^yellow;You really think so? If my suspicions are correct, the powers of your families share the same source with Shadastrophe.",


"^green;...you're right.

^yellow;Hm, I didn't mean to accuse you. I don't think you or your sister would know it at that time. Besides, Shadastrophe's already lost all its functions back then...
Take it, as a farewell gift of mine. It has seen me find my reality, and now, it's time for it to see your story.",


"^green;Well, looks like I don't have the right to refuse?

^yellow;Of course you don't...ugh, it's time to say goodbye now?

^green;It seems so. Farewell then.

^yellow;Farewell, and come back alive.
