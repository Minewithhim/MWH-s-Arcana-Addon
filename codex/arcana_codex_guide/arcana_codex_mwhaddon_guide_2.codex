"^orange;Illuminated stars^white; are one of the stars infused by what we Arcanian called 'Elements', with a pale appearance. They are the second most recommended stars to explore after Arcane Stars.
Nurtured by ^orange;Illuminated Essence^white;, Illuminated stars feature four different kind of unique planets: ^#8C8D90;Illuminated^white;, ^#D63BF2;Desolate^white;, ^#09A9AB;Evoaquatic^white; and ^#D82C4C;Animus^white;.
",


"All of these planets will have ^orange;Radiance^white; on explorers, increasingly lose their lives. Respective protection methods, such as EPP, is required to nullify the effect.
",


"^#8C8D90;Illuminated^white;

^#8C8D90;Illuminated^white; is the most important and representative planet among Illuminated stars, covered by exotic and pale landscape.
Faded ^#8C8D90;Holosium Fragments^white; and emerald ^#6AC57D;Renatine Fragments^white; fill the earth of Illuminated planet. The former can be melt into ^orange;Holosium Bars^white; while the latter into ^orange;Renatine Crystals^white;, both of which are important materials.
",


"In addition, this is the only place to locate ^orange;Illuminated Water^white;, one source of ^orange;Darklight Resins^white;.
",


"^#D63BF2;Desolate^white;

^#D63BF2;Desolate^white; is quite a deadly planet. Dangerous cosmic monsters sweep the lifeless land of ever-lasting night in flocks, let alone those gruesome ^#D03AD7;Horizon Fleets^white;.
Speaking of ^#D03AD7;Horizon Fleets^white;, the main materials they use in their armory are ^orange;Necroium Bars^white; melted from ^#973DC5;Necroium Fragments^white; which widely present beneath the surface of ^#D63BF2;Desolate^white;.
",


"^#09A9AB;Evoaquatic^white;

^#09A9AB;Evoaquatic^white; is a comforting ecosystem of yellow and green, colonized by various plants. You may even find a cave filled with giant fluorescent spikes and poptops.
Besides, ^#ADA729;Morphosis Shards^white; are hidden in the soil there, which display a high degree of affinity for a ^cyan;hypertoxic abominationr^white; created by Ecolife.
",


"^#D82C4C;Animus^white;

^#D82C4C;Animus^white; is an unpleasant planet, with few blue crystal trunks buried among crimson trees.
The ores featured here are ^#C31C2C;Anima Shards^white;, which, as well, can attract a ^cyan;flaming monster^white;'s attention.
",


"Another notably rare ore you can find here is ^#D53434;Avostone^white;, a red crystal widely used by Avians and Exousians.
