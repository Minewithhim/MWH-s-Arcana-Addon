"^orange;Tripolar stars^white; are one of the stars infused by what we Arcanian called 'Elements'. Recommend to explore when you have completed your exploration in Superstorm Stars.
Tripolar stars feature six different kind of unique planets: ^#ec9858;Solarized^white;, ^#9ec450;Bamboo Forest^white;, ^#e4c6ff;Eminsnow^white;, ^#f8bcc8;Senbonzakura^white;, ^#e7c475;Azure Desert^white; and ^#84cede;Azure Sea^white;.
",


"The stars are dominated by three celestial elementals: ^orange;Solar Essence^white;, ^orange;Lunar Essence^white; and ^orange;Azure Essence^white;, with numerous basic elementals sheltered among these planets.
Theses celestial elementals can arouse a phenomenon named ^green;Celestial Corridor^white;, which will be discussed at the end of this book.

"Deeply underneath the ground of some planets there you can find three unique minerals: ^#c64544;Aspirite^white;, ^#417b45;Noxion^white; and ^#6574c1;Immorite^white;. Each will drop ^orange;Intima Essence^white;, ^orange;Poison Essence^white; or ^orange;Anima Essence^white;.

"^#e7c475;Azure Desert^white;

",


"^green;Celestial Corridor^white;

In short, ^green;Celestial Corridors^white; are distortions aroused by celestial elementals. Three types of ^green;Celestial Corridors^white; exist: ^green;Solar^white;, ^green;Lunar^white; and ^green;Azure^white;. Each differs in its risk level and respective essence can be harvested in these corridors.
